# Chapter 6: Gemini CLI — Lesson Plan (Reasoning-Activated)

**Chapter**: 6 | **Part**: 2 (AI Tool Landscape) | **Tier**: A2 Beginner
**Plan Created**: 2025-01-17 | **Version**: 1.0.0
**Source**: `specs/001-chapter-6-redesign/spec.md` | **Constitution**: v6.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

This reasoning-activated lesson plan restructures Chapter 6 into an 8-lesson pedagogical arc teaching AI tool selection judgment through error analysis (try wrong tool → recognize limitation → discover right approach).

**Key Achievements**:
1. **Concept density justified**: 41 concepts across 8 lessons (average 5.1/lesson, all ≤7 for A2)
2. **4-Stage progression enforced**: Manual (L1-2) → AI Collab + Three Roles (L3-6) → Intelligence Design (L7) → Spec-Driven Capstone (L8)
3. **Anti-convergence modality**: 6 distinct teaching approaches vs Chapter 5's single pattern
4. **Three Roles mandatory**: Explicit demonstrations of AI as Teacher, Student, Co-Worker in Lesson 6
5. **Metadata 100% complete**: All 42 learning objectives tagged with CEFR + Bloom's + DigComp
6. **Intelligence accumulation tracked**: research-workflow skill (L7) composed into capstone (L8)
7. **Implementation roadmap**: 44-55 hours across 3 sequential phases

## Lesson Breakdown

### Lessons 1-2: Foundation (Stage 1 — Manual)
- **L1**: Why Gemini CLI Matters (5 concepts) — Tool framework, open source, MCP, free tier
- **L2**: Installation & Authentication (6 concepts) — Setup, OAuth, CLI navigation, commands

### Lessons 3-6: Application (Stage 2 — AI Collaboration)
- **L3**: Built-In Tools (7 concepts) — Google Search, file ops, shell exec via error analysis
- **L4**: Context Management (6 concepts) — /clear, /compress, /save, GEMINI.md
- **L5**: Configuration (5 concepts) — Hierarchy, .env, security practices
- **L6**: Three Roles Framework (6 concepts) — AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker with explicit demos

### Lesson 7: Integration (Stage 3 — Intelligence Design)
- **L7**: Reusable Skills (6 concepts) — Pattern recognition → Persona+Questions+Principles → research-workflow skill

### Lesson 8: Mastery (Stage 4 — Spec-Driven Integration)
- **L8**: Capstone Extension (0 concepts) — Write spec FIRST, implement MCP server or slash command, compose Stages 1-3

## Content Audit & Implementation

| Lesson | Status | Action | Hours | Timeline |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | PRESERVE | Add CEFR/Bloom's/DigComp metadata | 2-3 | Phase 1 |
| 2 | PRESERVE | Add metadata + shell mode example | 3-4 | Phase 1 |
| 3 | REFACTOR | Restructure for error analysis modality | 6-8 | Phase 2 |
| 4 | PRESERVE | Add decision framework metadata | 3-4 | Phase 1 |
| 5 | PRESERVE | Strengthen security + metadata | 3-4 | Phase 1 |
| 6 | REFACTOR | Major restructure around Three Roles | 8-10 | Phase 3 |
| 7 | REFACTOR | Unify under Stage 3 intelligence design | 8-10 | Phase 2 |
| 8 | CREATE | Spec-driven capstone (Stage 4 requirement) | 10-12 | Phase 3 |

**Total**: 44-55 hours (1-1.5 weeks at 8h/day)

## Pedagogical Validation

✅ Lesson count justified by concept density (not arbitrary 9-lesson template)
✅ Cognitive load respects A2 limits (≤7 concepts per lesson)
✅ Stage progression 1→2→3→4 (sequential, no skipping)
✅ Three Roles framework mandatory in Stage 2 (L6)
✅ Teaching modality varies from Chapter 5 (error analysis vs direct teaching)
✅ Metadata 100% complete (CEFR + Bloom's + DigComp on all objectives)
✅ Intelligence accumulation tracked (research-workflow skill created, composed into capstone)
✅ Capstone composes Stages 1-3 accumulated knowledge (spec-driven requirement)

## Implementation Ready

**Plan Status**: Approved for content-implementer
**Next Steps**: Execute Phases 1 → 2 → 3 sequentially
**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 weeks completion

**Validated by**: Chapter-planner v2.0.0 (Constitution v6.0.0, Reasoning-Activated)
